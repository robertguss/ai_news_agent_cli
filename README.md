## Features

### Current
- âœ… Basic CLI scaffold with Cobra framework
- âœ… Version information and help system

### Planned
- ðŸ”„ **Smart Fetching**: Automatically fetch content from curated AI news sources
- ðŸ”„ **AI-Powered Processing**: Summarize articles using OpenAI/Gemini APIs
- ðŸ”„ **Intelligent Deduplication**: Group duplicate stories from different sources
- ðŸ”„ **Priority-Based Sorting**: Tier-based source prioritization (Official blogs > Research > General tech media)

- ðŸ”„ **Flexible Filtering**: Filter by source, topic, content type, and read status

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.25 or higher
- OpenAI API key or Google Gemini API key
- SQLite (for local storage)

### Installation

```bash
go install github.com/robertguss/ai-news-agent-cli@latest
```

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Display help
ai-news-agent-cli --help

# Check version
ai-news-agent-cli --version

# Current functionality
ai-news-agent-cli
```

## Usage

### Planned Commands

Once fully implemented, the CLI will support these workflows:

```bash
# Fetch and process new AI news
ai-news-agent-cli fetch

# View unread news summaries
ai-news-agent-cli view

# View all news (read and unread)
ai-news-agent-cli view --all

# Filter by specific criteria
ai-news-agent-cli view --source "Google AI Blog"
ai-news-agent-cli view --topic "Large Language Models"
ai-news-agent-cli view --type "Research Paper"

# Read full article in terminal
ai-news-agent-cli read 3

# Open article in browser
ai-news-agent-cli open 3
```

### Example Workflow

1. **Fetch latest news**: `ai-news-agent-cli fetch`
2. **Review summaries**: `ai-news-agent-cli view`
3. **Read interesting articles**: `ai-news-agent-cli read 2`
4. **Open complex content in browser**: `ai-news-agent-cli open 5`

## Configuration

The application will use environment variables for configuration:

```bash
# Required: AI API credentials (choose one)
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-gemini-api-key"

# Optional: Database location
export AI_NEWS_DB_PATH="$HOME/.ai-news-agent/news.db"

# Optional: External tool configurations
export JINA_READER_URL="https://r.jina.ai"
export GLOW_STYLE="dark"
```
